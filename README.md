# Recon-ng-Lab
<h2>Lab Summary (What to expect) </h2>
In this lab, we will be utilizing Recon-ng on Kali Linux to automate the retrieval of WHOIS information for a target domain, using the example domain "facebook.com." The walkthrough includes creating a dedicated workspace, installing and configuring WHOIS search modules, and discovering valuable details such as location, contact information, and registration data. Additionally, readers will learn to leverage the HackerTarget.com API to identify subdomains associated with the target domain, providing insights into potential vulnerabilities for further exploration.
